	<h1>moonchild</h1>
	<p><i>short story written August 24, 2019 - September 29, 2019</i></p>

	<p>ever since he was born, he was destined to be alienated. looked down upon for his skin color. quiet compared to all the students bursting with chatter. alone in a classroom full of social cliques. hard working in school where “try-hards” are considered lame. trapped in the cycle of poverty. his father was addicted to drugs with little hope of escape. his mother worked two jobs to support the family, which left little to no time to be at home. </p>
	<p>so he sought someone to confide in, combat loneliness with, and share his feelings with.</p>
	<p>he’s fell in love with the moon.</p>
	<p>its mysterious, tranquil beauty was so mesmerising to watch in the solitary hours of darkness. she rose and fell in an eternal cycle, unchanged by the ever changing earth. sometimes she showed up as an appreciated surprise in the afternoon, faint against the blue skies. but most days he waited for night to fall. hours became days, days became weeks, weeks became months, and months became years. years and years of merely surviving, wondering what it would be like to be there. he was sure the moon was waiting for him. she always followed him in whichever direction. </p>
	<p>it looks like the moon is following everyone, stupid! they sneered. have fun trying. you’ll die without air. he didn’t listen. </p>
	<p>one day the child passed by a small puddle. the moon was reflecting on its surface. he immediately broke out in a smile and tried to touch her kindly, but the water rippled as his fingers sank through. he splashed and digged into the water; nothing. he felt like crying. the moon wanted to taunt him, for she was nothing but a dark mirror pretending to be something she’s not, bright and luminous. he ran back home and closed all the shades.</p>
	<p>again, the moon appeared on a lake, seemingly glowing with shimmers all around. it was a deep body of water; it looked treacherous in the night. he jumped in and swam over to her, rejoicing in her presence. he splashed and digged into the lit water, but the water rippled as his fingers sank through. tears spilled over his cheeks and into the icy lake, he cursed this terrible fate, and now had to go home soaking wet and cold, thin clothes sticking to a skinny body. his mother would not be happy after the long, long day to have to take care of him. he stared up at the moon in the sky for a second longer and then made up his mind to swim back to shore but the water started to sway and push him to and fro and tangle his limbs and sting his eyes and shove up his nose and fill his lungs as he coughed and he was suddenly underwater in pure blackness and gasping for air he flailed his arms trying to fight back but couldn’t find the surface and</p>

	<p>he had a dream. it was dimly lit. he sat on the barren surface of the moon. it was cold, but not too cold. there was no sound, no air, no life but he was there. he could see the earth from above, surrounded by countless twinkling stars billions of light years away. and all he could feel was happiness, but there was a realization. the moon is not living. she does not breathe or eat or think or feel or love. so he stood up, in solemn understanding, and buried his love in the moondust forever. </p>
